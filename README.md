## AC Phase Controller

The intention of this project is develop a PID based controller to be used in phase angle control applications.
This type of controller is easily implemented in a tiny microcontroller. But creating a block with VHDL we will win many advantages. 
First, we can multiply the number of controllers with no loss of performance. 
Second, using the FPGA or CPLD with our VHDL project we will win more resolution in the TRIAC gate control.

This code implements a phase angle controller,to be usable need add the SPI block do set de angle of work.
